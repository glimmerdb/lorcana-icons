<p align="center">SVG icons inspired by Lorcana TCG's card templating</p>
</p>

## Usage
Icons can be downloaded by navigating to the `icons` directory in this github repository.

### Customization
These svgs are designed to be ready for inlining into web applications. When inlined, the color of the icons will inherit whatever color is currently set for the parent element. This means these icons can easily adapt to your websites styles.

## Credits

A special thank you goes to [Nate of the cards](https://linktr.ee/nateofthecards), who did the original creation of the icons. Without Nate's help, this repository would not exist!
